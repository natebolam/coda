Coda is the first cryptocurrency with a lightweight, constant-sized blockchain. This is the main source code repository for the Coda project. It contains code for the OCaml protocol implementation, [website](https://codaprotocol.com), and wallet. Enjoy!

## Notes

- Coda is still under active development, and APIs are still evolving. If you do build upon the APIs, be aware that breaking changes may occur.
- There is a live testnet of the Coda protocol currently running - [sign up here to join the testnet](http://bit.ly/TestnetForm).
