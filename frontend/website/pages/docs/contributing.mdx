# Contributing to Coda

Coda is an open-source project with a mission to build an inclusive and sustainable community-driven protocol. As such, Coda welcomes contributions from anyone with a desire to further this goal.

Currently, the protocol is in development and would benefit from contributions in the form of writing code, user testing, documentation, and community support. Below, you will find specific instructions for contributing in each of these domains.

For any general questions on how to get involved, feel free to reach out to the Coda community on the [Discord server](https://bit.ly/CodaDiscord).

## Join the Public Testnet

The Coda public testnet beta is live. **Technical skill is not required**, and we encourage anyone with an interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchains to get involved. 

Specifically, we need help in the form of reporting bugs, validating economic assumptions, testing out node infrastructure, and general participation in consensus and compressing the blockchain. Please join the [Discord server](https://bit.ly/CodaDiscord) and checkout the #testnet-general and #testnet-beta channel to get involved. You can also [sign up for the Genesis program here](/genesis) and we'll keep you posted with updates!

Head over to the [testnet landing page](/testnet.html) to see how to participate in weekly challenges and get on the testnet leaderboard.
